# Tic Tac Go

I know what you're thinking, is this really a pun that has gotten out of hand? Yes. Yes it is.

## Installation

    $. go install

## Running

For a two player game run the following command

    $. tictac go

If you want to use the unbeatable AI (using the minimax algorithm) then add the ai flag

    $. tictac go --ai
